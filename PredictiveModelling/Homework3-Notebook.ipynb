    "This homework aims to analyse data generated by political candidates during the Irish General Elections 2016.\n",
    "We have a CSV file describing candidates named **ge16-candidates-elected-merged-clean.csv**. It contains data describing the candidates, e.g., name, party and constituency, and data on whether they got elected or not. \n",
    "It also contains data about the Twitter activity of the candidate, such as the candidate name and the number of tweets issued by their Twitter account, the number of followers the Twitter account has, etc. We aim to \n",
    "build and evaluate predictive models that use the descriptive features of each candidate, to predict whether the candidate got elected or not.\n",

    "1. [10pt] Getting Data: Download the data for Homework3 from Moodle. \n",
    "\n",
    "    - [5pt] Print the number of rows and columns in the dataset.\n",
    "    - [5pt] Print the first 10 rows and the last 10 rows.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. [30pt] Data Understanding: Exploring relationships between feature pairs:\n",
    "    - [5pt] Print the correlations between the continuous features (other than IDs).\n",
    "    - [5pt] Plot the scatter plots of each pair of continuous descriptive feature and target feature.\n",
    "    - [5pt] Discuss what you observe from the scatter plots and correlations, e.g., which continuous features seem to be better at predicting the target feature. Choose the best 3 continuous features.\n",
    "    - [10pt] For each categorical feature, plot the pairwise interaction with the target feature (barplots or stacked barplots).\n",
    "    - [5pt] Discuss what knowledge you gain from ploting the interaction of descriptive categorical features and the target feature, e.g., which categorical features seem to be better at predicting the target feature. Choose the best 3 categorical features.\n",

    "3. [20pt] Predictive Modeling: Linear Regression  \n",
    "    - [5pt] Train a linear regression model to predict the target feature Elected, using the 6 descriptive features selected in exercise 2.\n",
    "    - [5pt] Print the coeficients learned by the model and discuss their statistical significance.\n",
    "    - [5pt] Retrain the model using only the subset of features found to be statistically significant.\n",
    "    - [5pt] Using the above trained model, print the predicted target feature for all the examples in the training set. Threshold the predicted target feature at 0.5 to get the predicted class for each example. Print the accuracy of the model on the training set.\n",

    "4. [20pt] Predictive Modeling: Logistic Regression\n",
    "     - [5pt] Train a logistic regression model to predict the target feature Elected, using the 6 descriptive features selected in exercise 2.\n",
    "    - [5pt] Print the coeficients learned by the model and discuss their statistical significance.\n",
    "    - [5pt] Retrain the model using only the subset of features found to be statistically significant.\n",
    "    - [5pt] Using the above trained model, print the predicted target feature for all the examples in the training set. Print the predicted class for each example. Print the accuracy of the model on the training set.\n",

    "5. [20pt] Evaluating Predictive Models\n",
    "    - [5pt] Split the dataset into 70% training and remaining 30% test. Train linear regression and logistic regression on the training set using the 6 descriptive features selected in Ex2.\n",
    "    - [5pt] Predict with both models on the test set. Print classification evaluation metrics for both models on the test set (e.g., Accuracy, Confusion matrix, Precision, Recall, F1).\n",
    "    - [10pt] Rescale the descriptive features (range normalisation or standardisation), retrain both models and compare the classification quality on the test set (3pt). Which model performs best and is it more accurate than a simple model that always predicts not-Elected (i.e., Elected=0) (2pt)? Can you find any tricks to improve the best model so far (e.g., using feature significance, creating new features, or other knowledge)?(5pt)"
